    <p class="review">Months before we got our own place, my husband and I hashed out our preferences for flatware. I wanted something with very smooth, rounded edges (and I'd originally wanted gold before looking into how short-lived that finish would be). My husband wanted something sturdy and weighty &mdash; a spoon that you could scoop ice cream with and not completely destroy. We found our perfect fit at IKEA with the BEHAGFULL design. Every utensil feels strong and comfortable in hand. I prefer the brushed/matte finish to the more common shiny surface. One thing I will note though: if you use a rough scrubbing tool on the utensils, you will see marks on your finish. These run through the dishwasher just fine, but I have seen some minor pitting after a year of use.</p>

    <p class="review">While shopping at IKEA and heading to the cafeteria for some lunch, we came across the SYMFONISK display. An employee explained how it works: these SONOS speakers connect to most smart devices and will broadcast audio over WiFi. There is no way to directly connect to a device (e.g. though an aux cable). Still, my husband liked the idea and the sound quality the speakers put out, so we bought a couple of these speakers for our living room. They didn't have the white version in stock, so we settled for black. Over time we ended up buying an additional speaker for the bedroom, a lamp speaker that sits on the counter between the kitchen and living room, and a soundbar that sits under the tv. If you're going to bother getting any speaker system, you should be ready to commit to that technology so that you can connect all speakers in your home, so that's what we did. On the plus side, they all integrate, you can connect to different speakers in different rooms, or connect to all speakers so you don't miss anything as you move about the house, or create a sound environment so you have surround sound for your tv &mdash; lots of cool stuff. On the down side, if you have some issues with your wifi, you may need to power cycle your speakers to get them working properly again. You may also need to repair them with each other. We have also had some issues with the speakers dropping connection with our devices, although that may actually be an issue or incompatibility with our music streaming app and not with the speaker. Finally, there is no native application that will allow you to connect your windows PC to the speakers, which seems silly. You are, however, able to connect a Mac to the speakers via AirPlay.</p>

    <p class="review">This purchase came about after weeks of searching for a cabinet that could hold our less frequently used glassware. Our cabinet space is limited and already full of our daily use dishes, pots, pans, bakeware and glassware, so that left our adult beverage glasses, tea pot, etc. still packed away in the moving boxes. I didn't want a huge beast china cabinet like the kind my parents had, and I didn't want <i>too</i> much glass, because that just makes me nervous. I do like that IKEA has all their dimensions of their products available on their website, so once I determined my space limitations, I was ready to commit to this cabinet. I remember my husband complained about the doors not being perfect, but I've never really noticed. The doors move smoothly, and the unused space in the cabinet has served to display my husband's Star Wars lego assemblies... yep. It also spent some time as a snack cabinet.</p>

    <p class="review">There is a large closet in our master bedroom. Unfortunately, it is behind some very large double doors, and in order to keep that closet accessible, half the bedroom would have to be left completely empty to open those doors. We mostly use that closet for off-season clothing storage, but I wanted somewhere to hang hoodies/sweaters for chillier days. Wrestling the doors open and trying to keep the cats out of the closet was just too much of a hassle. I originally set out for a similar item that had bars on the bottom for flat storage, but that was out of stock, so I grabbed this instead. It is incredibly affordable and unobtrusive in the bedroom room. Comparable items on Amazon start at $20, and they don't share this more domestic aesthetic.</p>

    <p class="review">Before we broke down and got a reclining loveseat, our living room furniture was limited to two TV trays and two armchairs with ottomans (it took ages for us to get the matching ottoman for his chair &mdash; always out of stock). Mine was a blue velvet tufted dorm room-looking thing with wire legs, and my husband's was this much more mature-looking winged arm chair. We have different proportions, so this seat is much too deep for me, but my husband finds it incredibly comfortable and can even  nap in it. It hides crumbs and cat hair well, lint rolls easily, and the fabric is fairly durable. However, it is still no match for persistent cats who think it makes an excellent scratching surface or think it would look better without the buttons.</p>
